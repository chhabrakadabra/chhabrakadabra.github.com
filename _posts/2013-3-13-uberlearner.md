I have been working for a while on this online education platform called [Uberlearner](http://www.uberlearner.com). The idea is to have instructors create courses on the platform for free and have students take those courses for free. 

My original idea was to make this a market-place where instructors sold enrollments to their courses for a price. But upon seeing other companies doing similar stuff and upon some introspection, I decided to open-source Uberlearner and host it for free. In addition, by not concerning myself with revenue distribution, I can create tools for collaboration between multiple instructors. But that's a topic for another day!

Check out the source code at [the github repository](https://github.com/Uberlearner/uberlearner) and the code in action at [www.uberlearner.com](http://www.uberlearner.com).
