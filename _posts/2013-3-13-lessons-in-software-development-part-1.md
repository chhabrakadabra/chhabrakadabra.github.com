Being a bit late to the *importance-of-testing* party, I've only recently started appreciating its benefits. But now that I get it, it's great!

I'm currently working on the assessment features of Uberlearner (on the [develop_assessment branch](https://github.com/Uberlearner/uberlearner/tree/develop_assessment/uberlearner/assessment)). And it's going to be completely [test-driven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)! Over time, I plan to add tests to all the other code that I wrote before I saw the light.

Here are some videos that got me started. Hope they can do the same for you:

- [Michael Feathers - the deep synergy between testability and good design](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVZvoFGJTU)
- [David Cramer - Lessons in testing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_39Vbjx23Y)
- [Gary Bernhardt - Fast Test, Slow Test](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k)
- [Simon Meers - Django Testing Tips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScjhonARTvU)

There were also some videos in [pyvideo.org](http://pyvideo.org)
This in particular was very useful: [Carl Meyer - Testing and Django](http://pyvideo.org/video/699/testing-and-django)

And for a variety of contradictory talks (like "test with mock" and "stop mocking, start testing"):
